## Usage
```
- This program extracts data from a website and save it into an excel file. If the excel file is not found, 
it will automatically create a new excel file and store the data. Every time when the program is executed, 
it will overwrite the existing data in the excel file and store the most recent data to the execel file from the website.

- For this example, the program is able to extract the product "3-ply Surgical masks" details :
1)Product Name
2) Product URL
3) Product Price
3) Product Qty sold.
